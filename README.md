# Udundi Coding Challenge – Shopify Web Developer

## ⏱ Time Tracking

**Total time spent:** ~5 hours  
This was my first time using both Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, so I spent time learning their syntax and best practices while building.

## 📝 Notes

- All assets were sourced from the Figma file and provided ZIP package.
  - The photo was compressed from the original to allow better load time.
- A lightweight and responsive layout was prioritized.
- Scoped CSS was added where Tailwind alone didn’t cover specific needs.
